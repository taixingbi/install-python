 "Project Proposal" 9% 
"Project Proposal" is 0% in ANLY 515-90- O-2021/Spring, 

I contacted Martin Negron of this class two month ago, and asked "why got ZERO" without any comment. "It did not meet requirement".
 
He did not do that till yesterday (4/28). I still got ZERO, and the same comment. 

It is not possible to fix my proposal


Question:
Why he did not give comment of details about my home work? What is problem of my homework?
Just zero.

Why he did not tell early?


Lu yun also have some issue. she tole me she read requirement very clearly, she got only 58


Another Faculty member review my  "Project Proposal" and all other students homework 

I was treated unfair and I am hurting.

HU is respect diversity. I don't want to other student have same experience. We pay money but treat us like this.
